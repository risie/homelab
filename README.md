# Home Lab

Welcome to my home lab project. The goal of this project is to create an environment for for learning with minimal setup.
To start with, the setup will be intentionally simple. My hope is to reach a point where I feel the need for a better
solution and grow in to more advanced tools and services. But soon than later this will be properly over-engineered anyway.
