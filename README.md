# Home Lab

Welcome to my home lab project. The goal of this project is to create an environment for learning with minimal setup.
To start with, the setup will be intentionally simple. My hope is to reach a point where I feel the need for a better
solution and grow into more advanced tools and services. But sooner than later this will be properly over-engineered anyway.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:
```markdown
Homelab/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
```

## Setup

The first iteration of the home lab will be running locally and will not use any additional hardware.
I will however use virtualization of some form to start with.
- *No setup required.*
